# odin-recipes
This is me at the beginning of this project, putting what I've learned so far to the test. Woohoo! An adventure!

For this project I will be creating a brutalist website that features recipes. I will demonstrate that I know basic HTML codes, the ability to use Git, and the ability to create a boilerplate.
